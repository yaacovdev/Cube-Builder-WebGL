# Cube Builder WebGL
 A WebGL 3D game where the user builds in a 3d environment of cubes. The user can construct shapes out of cubes but is only able to click on the last placed cubes to place the next cube on the adjacent sides. The user has the option to change their camera angle as well as undo the placed cubes.
